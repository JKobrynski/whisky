# Whisky

One of the first apps I ever created rebuilt in **Neumorphic** style.

## Directories

- **root** - server
- **/client** - client

## Instalation

In both root and /client directories run:

```bash
yarn
```

Then run:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

If you run into any problems with this command you can alternatively run:

```bash
yarn start
```

In two separate terminals (one for server, one for client)

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
